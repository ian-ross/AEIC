# Getting Started

Aviation Emissions Inventory Code (AEIC) is used to estimate aviation
emissions using an aircraft performance model and a set of missions. It
produces inventories that can be sliced by aircraft type, time period, or
operating scenario to support analysis and reporting. Core modules cover
mission definitions, trajectories, performance models, emissions estimation,
gridding, and weather.

## Installation

This isn't done yet. We will do this soon as a separate PR.

AEIC is not currently available on PyPI. Instead, AEIC releases are hosted on
GitHub, and may be installed as follows:

**TBD**

## Units

AEIC uses SI units interally. Conventional non-SI units are used for input and
output as appropriate.
