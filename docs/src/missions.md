# Missions

Missions, i.e., flights to be simulated by AEIC, are currently represented by
the simple {py:class}`Mission <AEIC.missions.Mission>` class. The
{py:class}`Mission <AEIC.missions.Mission>` class represents only flights
following a great circle route between origin and destination airports. It
cannot represent "as-flown" trajectories from ADS-B data or other sources.
