# Documentation review #2 — AEIC

Review date: 2026-04-28. Scope: everything under `docs/`, plus top-level
markdown (`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`). "Public interface" =
names exported via `__init__.py` `__all__` plus CLI subcommands registered
in `pyproject.toml`. The previous review (saved as `documentation-review.md`,
2026-04-15) was completed — all items there were marked **DONE** and shipped
in PR #137. This review focuses on drift introduced *after* that, primarily
by:

| PR    | Commit    | Title                                                    |
|-------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| #134  | f354566   | Bring Mission class into line with OAG database          |
| #135  | 3ad3030   | Generate commented, formatted performance model TOML     |
| #138  | c7b650b   | Support multiple ERA5 temporal layouts in Weather class  |
| #139  | 50817c8   | Pre-V1 simulation fixes                                  |

Sphinx coverage was rebuilt for this review (`uv run sphinx-build -b
coverage docs docs/_build/review2-coverage`); see Appendix A.

Each finding is tagged **Critical** (users will hit errors or wrong
results), **Major** (misleading / silently outdated / missing public
surface), or **Minor** (cosmetic, duplication, typos).

---

## 1. Top items to fix first

| # | Severity | Where | Summary |
|---|----------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Critical | `docs/src/weather.md:21-34` | Example uses the pre-#138 `Weather('path', mission, track)` signature. The current constructor takes `(data_dir, file_resolution, data_resolution=None, file_format=None)` — the example will not run. **DONE** |
| 2 | Critical | `docs/src/performance_models/performance_model_files.md:101-114` | Example TOML uses `cas_lo` / `cas_hi`. The current model rejects these — fields are `cas_low` / `cas_high` (see `src/AEIC/data/performance/sample_performance_model.toml:23-36`). **DONE** |
| 3 | Critical | `docs/src/performance_models/performance_model_files.md:124` | Example TOML uses `Foo_kN`. Current field is `rated_thrust`. **DONE** |
| 4 | Critical | `docs/src/performance_models/performance_model_files.md:164-181` | Example TOML shows a single `[flight_performance]` table with 6 columns. PR #135 changed the generated layout to three separate tables (`[climb_flight_performance]`, `[cruise_flight_performance]`, `[descent_flight_performance]`) with 5 columns each. **DONE** |
| 5 | Critical | `docs/src/performance_models/performance_model_files.md:36-47` | The `aeic make-performance-model legacy` example is missing the **required** `--maximum-payload` flag (see `commands/make_performance_model.py:324-329`). The command will exit with "Missing option '--maximum-payload'". **DONE** |
| 6 | Critical | `docs/src/emission.md:94` | Cross-ref target `<AEIC.emissions.types.Emissions>` does not exist. The class lives at `AEIC.emissions.emission.Emissions` (re-exported as `AEIC.emissions.Emissions`). Broken link. **DONE** |
| 7 | Major | `docs/src/weather.md:11-12` | Prose still says `valid_time` is "sliced using `mission.departure.hour` if present". After #138, slicing is by `data_resolution`-aware nearest-time selection, not by hour. **DONE** |
| 8 | Major | `docs/src/configuration.md` (no entry) | PR #138 added a public enum `TemporalResolution` and helper functions `default_file_format` / `resolution_le` in `AEIC.config.weather`. None are mentioned in prose; only `WeatherConfig` is documented. **DONE** |
| 9 | Major | `src/AEIC/trajectories/builders/base.py:157` | `Builder.fly` docstring lists the third argument as `startMass`. The actual parameter is `starting_mass`. The autodoc render in `trajectory_builders.md` therefore documents a non-existent kwarg. **DONE** |
| 10 | Major | `docs/src/mission_database.md` | `TimeRangeQuery` is exported via `AEIC.missions.__all__` (added in #134) but is not mentioned anywhere in `mission_database.md`. **DONE** |

---

## 2. Docs don't match code

### Critical — stale/broken examples, dead imports, dead xrefs

- **Critical** `docs/src/weather.md:21-34` → `src/AEIC/weather.py:46-52`
  The example builds a `Mission` and `GroundTrack`, then constructs
  `Weather('data/weather/sample_weather_subset.nc', mission, track)`. After
  PR #138 the signature is
  `Weather(data_dir, file_resolution, data_resolution=None, file_format=None)`
  — `data_dir` must be a *directory*, not a file, and `file_resolution` is
  required. The example also passes `mission` and `track` positionally
  although the new constructor accepts neither. The companion call
  `weather.get_ground_speed(ground_distance, altitude, true_airspeed)` is
  still valid in isolation, but the surrounding setup is dead.
  *Fix:* rewrite the example to construct
  `weather = Weather('data/weather', TemporalResolution.DAILY)` (importing
  `TemporalResolution` from `AEIC.config.weather`), and either drop the
  mission/track preamble or move it into the `get_ground_speed` call site.
  **DONE** — replaced the example block in `weather.md` with a runnable
  one that imports `TemporalResolution`, constructs
  `Weather('data/weather', file_resolution=TemporalResolution.DAILY)`,
  uses `GroundTrack.great_circle(Location, Location)` (matching
  `ground_track.py:66`), and calls `get_ground_speed(time, gt_point,
  altitude, true_airspeed)` with the current keyword names.

- **Critical** `docs/src/performance_models/performance_model_files.md:101-114`
  → `src/AEIC/performance/types.py` and `src/AEIC/data/performance/sample_performance_model.toml:23-36`
  Example TOML uses `cas_lo` / `cas_hi`. Pydantic validation rejects these;
  the canonical names (and the names emitted by `make-performance-model`)
  are `cas_low` / `cas_high`.
  *Fix:* rename in all three `[speeds.*]` blocks.
  **DONE** — renamed `cas_lo` → `cas_low` and `cas_hi` → `cas_high` in all
  three `[speeds.*]` blocks in `performance_model_files.md`.

- **Critical** `docs/src/performance_models/performance_model_files.md:124`
  → `sample_performance_model.toml:46`
  Under `[LTO_performance]`, the example uses `Foo_kN = 102.695`. The real
  key is `rated_thrust`. (`Foo_kN` is a footing-of-thrust-model curiosity
  carried over from the original BADA OPF format and was never the field
  name on the legacy performance model.)
  *Fix:* `Foo_kN` → `rated_thrust`.
  **DONE** — renamed `Foo_kN` to `rated_thrust` under `[LTO_performance]`
  in the example TOML.

- **Critical** `docs/src/performance_models/performance_model_files.md:164-181`
  → `sample_performance_model.toml:87,179,250` and
  `commands/make_performance_model.py:381-383`
  The example shows a single `[flight_performance]` table with 6 columns
  (`fuel_flow, fl, tas, rocd, mass, ???`). The current generator (#135)
  emits three tables — `[climb_flight_performance]`,
  `[cruise_flight_performance]`, `[descent_flight_performance]` — each
  with 5 columns. The TOML schema in `LegacyPerformanceModel` enforces this
  three-table layout, so the example as written will not load.
  *Fix:* replace the single `[flight_performance]` block with the three
  per-phase tables (5 columns each: `fuel_flow, fl, tas, rocd, mass`).
  Linking to `sample_performance_model.toml` would also work.
  **DONE** — replaced the single `[flight_performance]` block with three
  per-phase tables (`[climb_flight_performance]`,
  `[cruise_flight_performance]`, `[descent_flight_performance]`), each
  with the current 5-column schema and a few representative data rows
  taken from `sample_performance_model.toml`.

- **Critical** `docs/src/performance_models/performance_model_files.md:36-47`
  → `commands/make_performance_model.py:324-329`
  The CLI example invocation:
  ```shell
  aeic make-performance-model \
    --output-file tmp.toml \
    legacy \
    --apu-name 'APU 131-9' \
    --number-of-engines 2 \
    --aircraft-class narrow \
    --ptf-file /home/bada/B738__.PTF \
    --lto-source edb \
    --engine-file engines/sample_edb.xlsx \
    --engine-uid 01P11CM121
  ```
  is missing the **required** `--maximum-payload` option. Click rejects
  the call before any work is done.
  *Fix:* add `--maximum-payload 22422 \` (matching the sample model).
  **DONE** — added `--maximum-payload 22422` to the example invocation.

- **Critical** `docs/src/emission.md:94` → `src/AEIC/emissions/__init__.py:1`
  Step 8 of the workflow says "Collects together all emissions data into a
  single `Emissions` value" with cross-ref
  `<AEIC.emissions.types.Emissions>`. There is no `AEIC.emissions.types`
  module in the tree. `Emissions` is at `AEIC.emissions.emission.Emissions`
  and re-exported as `AEIC.emissions.Emissions`. Sphinx will emit a
  reference warning and the link will not resolve.
  *Fix:* change to `AEIC.emissions.Emissions` (preferred — same as
  `emission.md:18` does) or `AEIC.emissions.emission.Emissions` (matches
  `emission.md:113`).
  **DONE** — fixed the cross-ref target to `AEIC.emissions.Emissions`,
  matching the re-export in `AEIC/emissions/__init__.py:1`.

### Major — divergent prose, broken xrefs, module-path typos

- **Major** `docs/src/weather.md:11-12` → `src/AEIC/weather.py:142-189`
  Prose says `valid_time` is "sliced using `mission.departure.hour` if
  present." Under #138, slicing depends on the relationship between
  `data_resolution` and `file_resolution`: when `data_resolution` is finer
  than `file_resolution` the code uses
  `ds.sel(valid_time=time, method='nearest', tolerance=...)`; otherwise
  `valid_time` is absent or length-1 and there is no slicing at all. The
  hour-based `isel` path is gone.
  *Fix:* replace the bullet with a description tied to `data_resolution`,
  e.g.:
  > a `valid_time` coordinate is required when `data_resolution` is finer
  > than `file_resolution`, in which case it is sliced by nearest-time
  > selection within a one-hour tolerance; otherwise `valid_time` is
  > optional and length-≤1.
  **DONE** — replaced the obsolete `mission.departure.hour` bullet with a
  description tied to `data_resolution` vs `file_resolution`, matching
  the `xarray.Dataset.sel(method='nearest', tolerance=1h)` behaviour
  introduced in #138.

- **Major** `src/AEIC/trajectories/builders/base.py:157` (autodoc target;
  surfaced via `docs/src/trajectories/trajectory_builders.md:64`)
  `Builder.fly`'s docstring `Args` block reads:
  > startMass (float, optional): Starting mass of the aircraft; ...
  but the real parameter name is `starting_mass`. autodoc renders the
  docstring verbatim, so users see a kwarg name that won't work.
  *Fix:* rename `startMass` → `starting_mass` in the docstring at
  `base.py:157`. (Spotted by visual inspection; the docstring was also
  using camelCase `startMass` in the AEIC v1 codebase, suggesting it
  predates the project's snake_case convention.)
  **DONE** — renamed the docstring parameter from `startMass` to
  `starting_mass` so it matches the actual signature.

- **Major** `docs/src/mission_database.md` (entire file, no occurrence)
  → `src/AEIC/missions/__init__.py:13`, `query.py:289-319`
  PR #134 added `TimeRangeQuery` to `AEIC.missions.__all__` and added it
  to `query.py`. It returns `(min_ts, max_ts)` of departure timestamps for
  a given filter — useful for date-range UIs and used internally by
  `aeic run` for sampling progress reports. `mission_database.md` lists
  the "main classes of interest" at lines 53-69 and never mentions
  `TimeRangeQuery`. The "Queries" overview at lines 117-125 explicitly
  says "Database queries come in three flavors" — now wrong, there are
  four.
  *Fix:* add `TimeRangeQuery` to the bullet list at L53-69, update the
  "three flavors" prose, and add a `### Time-range queries` subsection
  with an `autoclass` directive parallel to the existing
  `CountQuery` block.
  **DONE** — added `TimeRangeQuery` to the "main classes of interest"
  bullet list, updated the queries overview to "four flavors", and
  added a `#### Time-range queries` subsection with a usage example
  and an `autoclass` directive parallel to `CountQuery`.

- **Major** `docs/src/mission_database.md:156` → `src/AEIC/missions/query.py:87-110`
  Prose: "These queries return results as a generator of
  `AEIC.missions.query.QueryResult` values, each of which basically
  contains all of the known information about the **flight instances**."
  After #134, `QueryResult` inherits from `Mission` and its `from_row`
  classmethod returns a *plain* `Mission` (`return Mission(...)`, not
  `return cls(...)`). What `db(query)` actually yields is therefore
  `Mission` instances, not `QueryResult`. The `QueryResult` class still
  exists as a `RESULT_CONSTRUCTION_TYPE` marker but never appears in the
  output stream.
  *Fix:* change the prose to "...generator of `AEIC.missions.Mission`
  instances, populated from the corresponding flight instance rows." Then
  drop the trailing `autoclass:: AEIC.missions.query.QueryResult` directive
  at L198-201 (it documents an effectively internal helper) or replace it
  with prose noting it is a database-driver detail.
  **DONE** — updated the prose to say "`AEIC.missions.Mission` instances",
  removed the `QueryResult` bullet from the main-classes list (it is an
  internal database-driver helper, not part of the user-facing API), and
  dropped the `autoclass:: AEIC.missions.query.QueryResult` directive.

- **Major** `docs/src/configuration.md` (entire file, no occurrence)
  → `src/AEIC/config/weather.py:9-15,67-74`
  PR #138 introduced public symbols in `AEIC.config.weather`:
  - `TemporalResolution` (CIStrEnum: `HOURLY`, `DAILY`, `MONTHLY`,
    `ANNUAL`)
  - `default_file_format(file_resolution)` helper
  - `resolution_le(a, b)` helper
  These are imported by `AEIC.weather` (`weather.py:9-13`) and are part of
  the user-facing surface (a user constructing a `Weather` outside of the
  config singleton must pass a `TemporalResolution`). `configuration.md`
  only documents `WeatherConfig` (L132-138). The new fields on
  `WeatherConfig` (`file_resolution`, `data_resolution`, `file_format`)
  are picked up by the existing `automodule` directive but have no prose
  context describing the layout/format coupling rules.
  *Fix:* in `configuration.md`, before or after the `WeatherConfig`
  autoclass, add:
  - `.. autoenum:: AEIC.config.weather.TemporalResolution`
  - a one-paragraph description of the file/data resolution coupling
    (annual files allow literal filenames, monthly files require `%m`,
    daily files require `%d` or `%j`; data resolution must be
    finer-or-equal to file resolution; `HOURLY` is not allowed as a file
    resolution).
  Optionally surface `default_file_format` and `resolution_le` via
  `autofunction` if they are intended as public utilities; otherwise
  prefix them with `_`.
  **DONE** — added a "Weather module configuration" preamble to
  `configuration.md` describing `file_resolution` / `data_resolution` /
  `file_format` and the strftime-token rules, plus `autoenum` and
  `autofunction` directives for `TemporalResolution`,
  `default_file_format`, and `resolution_le`.

- **Major** `docs/src/trajectories/trajectory_builders.md:48-51` → `base.py`
  Prose: "Documentation for the base `Builder` class is currently sparse,
  and the best reference to how to use these things is to look at the
  `LegacyBuilder` implementation." This is no longer accurate: as of the
  prior review's docstring sweep and #139's edits, `Builder`, `Options`,
  and `Context` all carry attribute-level docstrings (see `base.py:18-71`)
  and the autoclass directive at L64-66 renders a usable reference.
  *Fix:* rewrite the paragraph or remove it. Suggested replacement:
  > The base `Builder` class, the `Options` dataclass, and the `Context`
  > dataclass are documented below. `LegacyBuilder` is the most complete
  > reference implementation.
  **DONE** — replaced the obsolete "documentation is sparse" paragraph
  with one pointing readers to the autoclass-rendered reference below
  and to `LegacyBuilder` as the working example.

- **Major** `docs/src/trajectories/trajectory_builders.md:53-61` (warning
  block) → `src/AEIC/trajectories/trajectory.py`
  The warning block says "There needs to be a way to incrementally extend
  trajectories instead of having to specify the length of the trajectory
  up-front." This was addressed in commit 6c9f0d5 ("Extensible
  trajectories"); the current `Trajectory` class supports `append` /
  `fix` extensible mode (see also `trajectory_data.md`).
  *Fix:* remove the obsolete warning, or rewrite to flag whatever is
  *currently* unfinished (e.g., extra LTO flight phase helpers, which is
  the second clause and may still be true — verify against
  `trajectories/builders/legacy.py` before keeping that wording).
  **DONE** — dropped the obsolete extensibility-and-smoother-API
  language; kept and tightened the still-accurate note that there are
  no built-in helpers for the "extra" LTO flight phases.

### Major — undocumented public symbols introduced after the prior review

- **Major** `AEIC.config.weather.TemporalResolution`,
  `default_file_format`, `resolution_le` — see prior bullet.

- **Major** `AEIC.missions.TimeRangeQuery` — see prior bullet.

- **Major** `AEIC.trajectories.builders.LegacyOptions` etc. → already
  exported pre-#137 but the prior review only noted the *Builder* classes
  (TASOPT/ADSB/Dymos). The `Options` companions (`TASOPTOptions`,
  `ADSBOptions`, `DymosOptions`, `LegacyOptions`) are also in
  `__all__` (`trajectories/builders/__init__.py:7-19`). `LegacyOptions`
  has docstrings (`legacy.py:24-36`); the WIP-builder option classes have
  none. They get pulled into the WIP sections of `trajectory_builders.md`
  via the package-level `automodule` only indirectly.
  *Fix:* either (a) add a note in each WIP subsection that the matching
  `*Options` class is unimplemented, or (b) drop the `*Options` classes
  from `__all__` until the corresponding builders are implemented.
  **DONE** — added a top-level note in the "Work-in-progress builders"
  section flagging that each builder has a matching `*Options` class
  whose fields will change, and named the relevant `TASOPTOptions`,
  `ADSBOptions`, `DymosOptions` cross-refs in their respective
  subsections. Updated each per-builder warning to make clear both the
  builder *and* its options class are stubs.

### Minor

- **Minor** `src/AEIC/emissions/ei/hcco.py:10-38` (autodoc'd via
  `emission.md:162`)
  PR #139 added an optional `label: str = ''` parameter to
  `EI_HCCO`, used in a warning string at L41. The Numpydoc Parameters
  block was not updated to mention `label`.
  *Fix:* add a `label` entry under Parameters describing it as an
  optional engine/aircraft tag included in calibration warnings.
  **DONE** — added a `label` entry to the Numpydoc Parameters block
  describing it as an optional tag included in calibration warnings.

- **Minor** `docs/src/emission.md:18,113` — inconsistent xref style
  Line 18 uses `<AEIC.emissions.Emissions>` (top-level re-export); line
  113 uses `<AEIC.emissions.emission.Emissions>` (deep path). Both
  resolve, but the inconsistency makes the doc harder to maintain.
  *Fix:* settle on one style across the file. `AEIC.emissions.Emissions`
  is shorter and matches the `__all__` re-export.
  **DONE** — switched the line-113 cross-ref and the autoclass directive
  to the `AEIC.emissions.Emissions` re-export, matching the other
  references on the page.

- **Minor** `docs/src/oag.md:21-30` — option summary uses a slightly
  awkward double-bullet style ("`-i` / `--in-file` (required)") while
  `docs/src/cli.md` uses tables. Not wrong, but the docs would benefit
  from a consistent style for CLI reference.
  *Fix:* convert the bullet list at L26-30 to a four-column option table
  (Option | Type | Required | Description), matching `cli.md`.
  **DONE** — replaced the bullet list with a four-column option table
  matching the format used in `cli.md` for `aeic run`, `merge-stores`,
  and `make-file-bundle`.

- **Minor** `docs/src/cli.md:8,9,13` — the CLI table sends the user to
  three different pages (`oag.md`, `performance_model_files.md`,
  `gridding.md`) for `convert-oag-data`, `make-performance-model`, and
  `trajectories-to-grid`, but provides inline detail sections (with flag
  tables) for `run`, `merge-stores`, and `make-file-bundle`. The
  asymmetry is by design (see prior review §4) but it surprises readers.
  Consider either (a) inlining flag tables for all six commands in
  `cli.md` and trimming the per-command pages to prose, or (b) adding a
  short "Common options" line to each table-row entry so users skimming
  cli.md can predict whether the linked page covers flags.
  **DONE** — added a `note` block immediately after the subcommand
  table in `cli.md` calling out which three commands are documented
  inline below and which three have flag tables on dedicated topic
  pages, so readers skimming the table can predict where the flag
  reference will be without clicking through.

- **Minor** `docs/src/storage.md:23-27`
  > "The public surface is re-exported at package level so that
  > everything can be imported from `AEIC.storage` directly."
  True today, but the next sentence (which would point users at the
  authoritative list) is missing. The `__all__` list contains 10 names;
  with no per-name guidance, users may not realize that
  `track_file_accesses` is a *context manager* used at CLI entry points
  and not for general code.
  *Fix:* add a single-line callout for `track_file_accesses` /
  `access_recorder`, noting that they wrap the entire `aeic run` command
  and shouldn't be entered manually inside a normal Python session.
  **DONE** — added a `note` block in `storage.md` calling out
  `track_file_accesses` as a CLI-level context manager, not something to
  open per-trajectory in interactive use.

## 3. Undocumented public paths

### Major

- **Major** `AEIC.missions.TimeRangeQuery` — covered in §2.
- **Major** `AEIC.config.weather.TemporalResolution`,
  `default_file_format`, `resolution_le` — covered in §2.
- **Major** `*Options` companions for WIP builders — covered in §2.

### Spot-checks (no action required)

- `AEIC.emissions.__all__` contains `compute_emissions`,
  `EMISSIONS_FIELDS`, `Emissions`. All three are referenced by
  `emission.md`. Note that `emission.md:18` already cross-refs the
  re-exported `AEIC.emissions.Emissions` path, which is the right one to
  prefer everywhere.
- `AEIC.storage.__all__` is fully documented via the `automodule`
  directive in `storage.md:32` (added by the prior review).
- `AEIC.trajectories.__all__` (`Trajectory`, `GroundTrack`,
  `BASE_FIELDSET_NAME`) is fully documented across `trajectories/*.md`.
- `AEIC.gridding`, `AEIC.performance.models`, and `AEIC.config` exports
  match their respective doc pages.

---

## 4. CLI documentation gaps

The previous review added `docs/src/cli.md` and adjusted the per-page
flag tables. Re-checking each subcommand against `commands/*.py` post-#134
and #139:

| Subcommand | Documented? | Issues |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| `convert-oag-data` | Yes (`oag.md`) | OK. Flags match `commands/convert_oag_data.py`. Stylistic improvement noted in §2 (Minor). |
| `make-performance-model` | Yes (`performance_model_files.md`) | **Critical issues** with sample TOML and missing `--maximum-payload` (§2). |
| `make-performance-model tasopt` | Yes (warning in `performance_model_files.md:24-31`) | OK. Still a `NotImplementedError` stub. |
| `run` | Yes (`cli.md:15-77`) | Flags table matches `commands/run_simulations.py`. PR #139 did not change the click signature. |
| `merge-stores` | Yes (`cli.md:79-109`) | OK. |
| `make-file-bundle` | Yes (`cli.md:111-137`) | OK. |
| `trajectories-to-grid` | Yes (`gridding.md`) | Not re-audited in this pass; the prior review noted the table matches code. |

No newly-introduced subcommands or top-level flags were detected
between commits 859bf8e and HEAD.

---

## 5. Cross-file duplication / consistency

- **Minor** `docs/src/cli.md:8,9,13` table style asymmetry — see §2.

- **Minor** `docs/src/oag.md:26-30` vs `docs/src/cli.md:26-36` — see §2.

No new duplications were introduced since the prior review. The
`data-dictionary.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.mb` / `CHANGELOG.md` issues from
that review have been resolved.

---

## 6. Other finds

- **Minor** Sphinx coverage builder still reports
  `CIBaseModel.normalize_keys` as undocumented (Appendix A). This was
  already in the prior review's Appendix B and was deferred.

- **Minor** `docs/src/trajectories/trajectory_builders.md:55` — warning
  bullet about needing a way to "incrementally extend trajectories" is
  obsolete (see §2 Major).

- **Minor** `docs/src/configuration.md:135-138` — the `WeatherConfig`
  autoclass directive uses `:exclude-members: model_config`, which is the
  right pattern, but `effective_data_resolution` and
  `effective_file_format` (computed properties added in #138) are
  re-exposed via `automodule`. Worth verifying in the rendered output
  that they show up under the `WeatherConfig` reference. If they don't,
  add `:members:` explicitly listing them.
  **DONE** — verified via `uv run sphinx-build -b html` that both
  `effective_data_resolution` and `effective_file_format` appear in the
  rendered `configuration.html` under the `WeatherConfig` reference. The
  bare `:members:` directive picks them up because they are
  `@property`-decorated; no source change is required.

directive, so this is a narrow signal. Modules that have no autodoc
reference (and therefore aren't measured) include
`AEIC.config.weather` helpers (covered above), the `AEIC.commands.*`
modules (intentional — they are CLI entry points), and parts of
`AEIC.utils.progress`. These are the real coverage gaps.

The previous review's Appendix B reported `LegacyBuilder.fly_climb` and
`LegacyBuilder.fly_descent` as undocumented. As of HEAD both methods
have docstrings (`legacy.py:244-248,257-263`). The
`AEIC.trajectories.builders.legacy` module is now at 100% coverage.
`AEIC.utils.airports` is also clean (the `:exclude-members:` directive
that hid `AirportsData` / `CountriesData` was removed in the prior
review).

## Appendix B — Verification notes

A few claims surfaced by exploratory passes were investigated and
**ruled out** before being included above:

1. *Did PR #139 remove docstrings from `fly_climb` / `fly_descent`?* —
   No. Both methods carry docstrings at `legacy.py:244-248,257-263`,
   matching what the prior review added. `fly_cruise` is also
   documented at `legacy.py:402-406`. The Sphinx coverage builder
   confirms `AEIC.trajectories.builders.legacy` is at 100%.
2. *Does the `aeic make-performance-model legacy` example pass an
   invalid `--aircraft-name` flag?* — No. The example passes
   `--apu-name 'APU 131-9'`, which is a real (optional) flag at
   `make_performance_model.py:330-334`. There is no `--aircraft-name`
   flag (the aircraft name is derived from the PTF file at
   `make_performance_model.py:372`).
3. *Does `Database.__call__` return `QueryResult` objects?* — Not in
   practice: `QueryResult.from_row` returns `Mission(...)` rather than
   `cls(...)` (see `query.py:91-110`), so callers receive `Mission`
   instances. Documented as a Major finding in §2.
