Welcome to AEIC's documentation!
================================

The **Aviation Emissions Inventory Tool** (``AEIC``) is a Python library for modelling and aggregating global aviation emissions over time.
Based on a previous version made using ``MATLAB`` by Simone et al. (found `here <https://zenodo.org/records/6461767>`_), this updated
library seeks to migrate the MATLAB functionality to Python and add support for previously unsupported performance models,
updated trajectory dynamics, parallelization, and more.
