# Mission database

The `Database`, `Query` and `Filter` classes in the `missions` package give
access to flight schedule data for mission planning. Currently this is
primarily intended for use with OAG data converted from CSV files. The
database files use a schema optimized for the query patterns used in AEIC.
This optimization is important because the flight schedule data tends to
contain a large number of records, and we want to be able to filter them in
several different ways.

To understand the way the database is organized, it helps to distinguish
between **flights** and **flight instances**. A **flight instance** is a
single flight between an origin and a destination airport departing at a given
time on a given date. A **flight** represents a sequence of **flight
instances** by defining a schedule of days of the week and departure time
between a pair of effective dates. A **flight** corresponds to a single row in
an input OAG CSV file, and each **flight** may have multiple **flight
instances**. The **flight instances** are reified in the SQLite database to
make querying the schedule of flights more efficient.

## Usage example

Here's a basic usage example to give an idea of how the API works:

```python
import missions

# Open the database.
db = missions.Database('oag-2019.sqlite')

# Build a scheduled flight query.
query = missions.Query(
    # Filter on flight characteristics.
    filter=missions.Filter(
        # Flight distance between 9500 and 10000 kilometers.
        min_distance=9500, max_distance=10000,
        # Seat capacity >= 500.
        min_seat_capacity=500,
        # Flight origin or destination in US or Canada.
        country=['US', 'CA']
    )
)

# Iterate over the flight results: there are only 46 from this query...
for flight in db(query):
    # ... so it's practical just to print some data.
    print(flight.departure.isoformat(), flight.carrier + flight.flight_number)
```

## Reference documentation

The main classes of interest in the API are:

- `Database`: the main database class;
- `Query`: a query that returns a sequence of **flight instances**;
- `QueryResult`: a single result from an `Query` query;
- `FrequentFlightQuery`: a query that returns most frequent origin/destination
  pairs appearing in **flight instances**;
- `FrequentFlightQueryResult`: a single result from an `FrequentFlightQuery`
  query;
- `CountQuery`: a query that counts **flight instances** matching given
  conditions;
- `Filter`: a filter on **flight** characteristics usable with all query
  types.

### Database class

The `missions.Database` class is a wrapper around a connection to an SQLite
database file (using the Python standard library's
[`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) package). The
`Database` class hides the details of both the database structure and the
underlying SQL interface to SQLite, instead exposing a simple
application-specific query API.

The `Database` class is oriented towards read-only access to a mission
database. There is a derived class called `WritableDatabase` for applications
that construct flight databases.

The normal workflow for querying the mission database is to create a
`Database` instance, passing the path to the SQLite database file to the
constructor:

```python
db = missions.Database('oag-2019.sqlite')
```

The `Database` object is callable, and when you call it with query objects
(see below), it returns a Python
[generator](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/) that
you can iterate over to get individual results:

```python
for flight in db(missions.Query()):
    print(flight.carrier + flight.flight_id)
```

(Don't try to run this code! It will iterate through *every* **flight
instance** in the database in departure time order. An empty `Query` selects
all **flight instances**.)

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: missions.Database
   :special-members: __init__, __call__
```

### Queries

Database queries come in three flavors. **Flight instance** queries,
represented by the `missions.Query` class, return **flight instances** in
departure time order, filtered by various criteria. Frequent flight queries,
represented by the `missions.FrequentFlightQuery` class, return pairs of
origin and destination airports that have the most flights between them, again
filtered by various criteria. Count queries, represented by the
`missions.CountQuery` class, count the number of **flight instances** that
match given conditions.

The filtering criteria for the different query types share some features in
common, so the query classes are derived from a `QueryBase` base class. Each
of the query classes has a `RESULT_TYPE` member that gives the type of the
results returned when you run one of these queries.

#### Base query class

The base query class includes filter parameters for the **flight instance**
start and end dates to consider, as well as an `missions.Filter` value that
filters on **flight** characteristics (like origin and destination, distance,
etc.).

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: missions.query.QueryBase
   :inherited-members: filter, start_date, end_date
   :exclude-members: to_sql
```

#### Scheduled flight queries

The `missions.Query` class returns individual **flight instances** in
departure time order, corresponding to a given set of filter conditions. This
query type supports **flight** characteristics filtering (using
`missions.Filter`), start and end date filtering (from `missions.QueryBase`)
and random and "every nth day" sub-sampling (using the `sample` and
`every_nth` parameters).

These queries return results as a generator of `missions.query.QueryResult`
values, each of which basically contains all of the known information about
the **flight instances**.

The following examples illustrate some uses of `missions.Query`.

Return all **flight instances** for all **flights** with a distance between
1000 and 5000 kilometers:

```python
q = missions.Query(filter=missions.Filter(min_distance=1000, max_distance=5000))
```

Return a random 5% sample of **flight instances** for all flights between
France and China:

```python
q = missions.Query(filter=missions.Filter(country=['FR', 'CN']), sample=0.05)
```

Return all 787 **flight instances** from France to China departing every 8th
day starting on March 1 2019:

```python
q = missions.Query(
    filter=missions.Filter(
        origin_country='FR',
        destination_country='CN',
        aircraft_type='787'
    ),
    start_date=date(2019, 3, 1),
    every_nth=8
)
```

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: missions.Query
   :members: every_nth, sample, RESULT_TYPE
   :exclude-members: to_sql
```

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: missions.query.QueryResult
   :members:
   :exclude-members: from_row
```

#### Frequent flights queries

The `missions.FrequentFlightQuery` class returns airport pairs (discounting the
direction, i.e., BOS → LHR is the same as LHR → BOS) and counts of flights
between them matching a given filter condition. The filter conditions
supported are the same as for **flight instance** queries, i.e. represented by
an `missions.Filter` instance. Results are returned as a generator of
`missions.query.FrequentFlightQueryResult` values, which contain the airport codes
and a count of the number of **flight instances**.

For example, if we want to find the ten most common routes flown by 787s, we
can do:

```python
>>> import missions
>>> db = missions.Database('oag-2019.sqlite')
>>> q = missions.FrequentFlightQuery(filter=missions.Filter(aircraft_type='787'), limit=10)
>>> for f in db(q):
>>>     print(f.airport1, f.airport2, f.number_of_flights)
```

with output

   :exclude-members: to_sql
```

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: missions.query.FrequentFlightQueryResult
   :members:
   :exclude-members: from_row
```

#### Count queries

Sometimes we just want a count of the number of **flight instances** matching
a filter. For example, before running some long computation on each **flight
instance**, it's useful to know if there are millions of them... Running an
`missions.CountQuery` query returns a single integer count value, i.e., there is no
generator involved.

For example, if we want to count the total number of 777 **flight instances**
in the database, we can do:

```python
>>> import missions
>>> db = missions.Database('oag-2019.sqlite')
>>> db(missions.CountQuery(filter=missions.Filter(aircraft_type='777')))
108906
```

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: missions.CountQuery
   :members: RESULT_TYPE
   :exclude-members: to_sql
```

### Filters

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: missions.Filter
   :members:
   :exclude-members: to_sql
```

## Database schema

The database schema for the mission database is described [on the GitHub
wiki](https://github.com/MIT-LAE/AEIC/wiki/OAG-database) for AEIC. (The wiki
page is slightly outdated: the definitive documentation for the database
schema is `_ensure_schema` method of the `missions.WritableDatabase` class.)
